Recently I wrote a series of posts for the IBM run site [Mobile Business Insights](http://mobilebusinessinsights.com) that laid out the various options for building mobile apps - from targeting mobile web browsers to hybrid app development to JavaScript Native and even pure native development. The idea here was to lay out the various options to help decision-makers choose which option best suits their needs. But that is really only a small part of the problem.

Here's the truth though, and one I don't fully tackle in the final part of the series - while knowing the available options is useful, in the end, it probably isn't the key to choosing the right option. Developers like to talk a lot about having many tools in the toolbox and "choosing the right tool for the job." The implication is that we will evaluate all of the available tools for the job and then, based upon an objective set of specifications, choose the most appropriate tool.

This is just plain wrong - or at the very least, not how anyone really does things.

## Tool are at the Center of the Developer Universe

First, it implies that the tool is somehow central to the success or failure of a project. However, the ugly truth is that there are 1,000 ways to patch together the tools for a project that will work. Anyone who has worked any amount of time as a developer knows that a project can succeed, even with suboptimal tools - or, alternatively, that a project can fail with the "right" tool choice.

In all the years I spent developing, I never recall the choice of tools or platform being the ultimate failure of a project - though they may have been the source of numerous headaches.

The truth is, choosing the right tools or platform for your mobile project comes down to two things:
- The skills and quality of your existing team
- Money

As you might imagine, the two are somewhat interconnected.

## Evaluating Your Team

If you want to choose the right mobile development platform, start by looking at your team:
- What are their existing skills? And what is the overall skill level?
- How comfortable are they with learning new skills?
- How confident are you in their ability to get the project done?

If you have a very highly skilled development team
