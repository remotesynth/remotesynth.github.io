I'm a big music lover, and while 2016 was probably light on my music purchases compared to prior years, it still featured some great music. So, here's my sort of traditional top songs of the year post (in case you're curious, [here's last year's post](http://www.remotesynthesis.com/general/2015/12/16/best-music-of-2015/)).<!--more-->

### 1. On Hold - The XX

This song is from the upcoming album by the XX called 'I See You', which is due later this month. If the rest of the album is as incredible as this song, this album could be better than their debut album (which was fantastic). Plus, they sample Hall and Oates! You gotta love that.

### 2. Not Today - Annabel Jones

I'd never heard of Annabel Jones before but I'm glad I have now. Her EP, ':Libelle', is really good, but this song is, by far, the standout. And, strangely, even though the song isn't openly political in anyw way, it fit my mood perfectly around this year's US election (particularly the lyrics, "I tore out the first page, hatted every word that I said. I can't smile, not today).

### 3. A Love Song - Ladyhawke

Ladyhawke has always been consistently good. Her latest album, 'Wild Things', is full of fantastic songs with her typical 80s vibe (though slightly less hard-edged than prior albums imo), but Love Song is just so damn catchy and good! Honestly, I can't stop listening to this song...plus it has a totally fun and cheesy video.

### 4. Haelos - Seperate Lives

After releasing singles over the past couple of years, Haelos finally released a full-length album called 'Full Circle'. It's worth a listen! I love this particular song in part because it has a killer beat.

### 5. You Don't Get Me High Anymore - Phantogram

Phantogram are another band that I've been a fan of for quite some time. The first time I heard this song, I _had to have_ the whole album...ASAP (named 'Three'). Unfortunately, the rest of the album doesn't quite live up to those high expectations imo (not saying it's bad), but this song is still well-worth the entrance fee.

### 6. Chairlift - Show U Off

Chairlift have been a favorite of mine for a while. Their recent (and [apparently last](http://pitchfork.com/news/70470-chairlift-break-up/)) almbum together is as excellent as always - great retro-tinged pop. Show U Off was my favorite and what I listened to all this past summer while on Cape Cod.

### 7. What's It Gonna Be? - Shura

Shura's debut full-length album is fantastic and features a number of great songs (on of which, 2Shy, I [featured last year](http://www.remotesynthesis.com/general/2015/12/16/best-music-of-2015/)). This one is my favorite because it is upbeat, catchy and great to run to.

### 8. Oh Wonder - Without You

Female/male vocal duos are hot lately (see The XX and Haelos above). Unlike those others, though, Oh Wonder offers a light, folky style of pop. Their debut album is great with a number of notable songs, but this one is my favorite, if only because it makes me think of my wife every single time.

### 9. Miike Snow - Genghis Khan

Not only is this a great and incredibly catchy song, but it also features my favorite video of the year.

### 10. The Range - Florida

I don't buy a lot of straight electronica without vocals anymore, but this song is too damn good (and apparently features an Ariana Grande sample, though I don't recognize it). I bought the whole album, but, unfortunately, it far less accessible than this song imo.
