This morning, I read an [interesting article by Patrick Kulp on Mashable](http://mashable.com/2017/01/05/ad-blocking-slowing-possibly/#ndN0Cb86Haqs). It discusses the so called "ad block apocalypse" that many people were concerned about when Safari on iOS enabled ad blockers. The gist of this concern was that content-focused sites were already having difficulty surviving due to declining ad rates (which desktop ad blockers certainly didn't help). If ad-blocking took off on mobile, the entire business model could collapse.

As the article notes though, ad blocking rates have leveled off or are on the decline in many parts of the world, and usage, overall still remains relatively small. So...crisis averted?

Well, not entirely. First off, the [entire model still remains broken](http://www.remotesynthesis.com/blog/broken-content). In fact, it is almost exemplified by the very site that this article is published on, as I reference in the Twitter conversation below.
