I follow hundreds of sites - using RSS! Yes, RSS. Sure, I use Twitter, but Twitter is just a very inconvenient way to do ensure you find quality content. It's like using a metal detector on the beach - maybe you'll find something worthwhile, after you finish sifting through tons of trash.

I spent a little time today finally cleaning up the sites I subscribe to - removing sites that aren't creating new content or have otherwise disappeared (on a side note, it's sad to see some of the people I was a fan of stop writing) and fixing feeds where the feed URL has changed. I figured it'd be worth sharing an export of the sites that I follow in case anyone else wants to follow as well. You can download the [OPML file](/assets/posts/front-end-feeds.xml) here, which should be easy enough to import into any feed reader you use (I use [NewsBlur](http://www.newsblur.com/) fwiw).
