I've worked from home, on and off, since I joined Universal Mind back in 2008. That job was fully remote. My following position was remote 2-3 days a week. My first year at Adobe was fully in the office, but the following two years were fully remote. Now, my role with Telerik/Progress for the past 3 years (almost!) has been fully remote.

Honestly, for me personally, I am not sure I could ever go back. Sure, I occassionally miss the interaction you get in an office, but it is something that works for me and my way of life. I enjoy being around for the kids when they get home from school or being able to live a healthy lifestyle because I am not stuck in an office all day. My recent move to the Orlando, Florida, area was completely made possible by the fact that I work from home.

If you work from home or are interested in working from home (or are interested in becoming a freelancer), [Dan Gough](https://twitter.com/dandgough) started a site where he interviews freelancers and remote workers called [Remotely Interested](http://www.remotelyinterested.co/). Check it out. It's worth a read.
