Walt Mossberg has an [interesting post about the way email is changing](http://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15099510/walt-mossberg-email-growing-changing-vs-slack-snapchat-chat). From once dominating electronic communication, it is now becoming more like traditional mail, in that it's most junk and marketing with the occassional official communications mixed in with a newsletter subscription or two. It's not just generally unpleasant, but it's also the easiest route for scammers.

> By and large, email is now a generally unpleasant, often untrustworthy, and sometimes literally perilous experience that deserves less and less of our time and attention. But it’s not dead, and I don’t expect it to disappear anytime soon. Just be wary of it.

Rather than die, email is now supplemented with Slack, Twitter, Facebook, SnapChat, etc. However, none of these things has _replaced_ email, so we're stuck, for the moment, with a multitude of communication channels.
