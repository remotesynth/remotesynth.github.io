2017 has been very quiet for me on the speaking front, but, as it turns out, busier than ever on the event front. I am organizing a lot of events this Fall - online, in NYC and in Sofia, Bulgaria (with more in the works too). All of the events are either free or incredibly inexpensive. Here's an overview:<!--more-->

JavaScript development has seen a lot of changes in recent years, between new specifications like ES6 and ES7 to new tooling like TypeScript.

[![Exploring JavaScript Frameworks](/images/posts/events2017/JSFrameworks.jpg)](http://certifiedfreshevents.com/events/exploring-javascript-frameworks/)

## [Exploring JavaScript Frameworks](http://certifiedfreshevents.com/events/exploring-javascript-frameworks/)
### Online
### October 5
#### Cost: Free

It seems that there are few guarantees in life, but two of them are that the sun will rise in the morning and, with it, will come at least two new JavaScript frameworks. So how is a developer supposed to keep up? How can you tell the contenders from the pretenders? In this free online event, Jen Looper and Holly Schinsky will take a look at some of the more prominent new frameworks to help you decide if they are worth exploring further.

[![Going Serverless](/images/posts/events2017/Serverless.jpg)](http://certifiedfreshevents.com/events/going-serverless/)

### Online
### October 20
#### Cost: Free

Lately the term serverless is everywhere, which naturally makes developers skeptical that it is a marketing buzzword. However, behind the term is a useful concept of tools and architecture that takes the need to worry about servers (if not actual servers themselves) out of the equation. In this free online event, Burke Holland and James Thomas will explore what serverless is, why it is an important new development, and where it will haev the most impact.
