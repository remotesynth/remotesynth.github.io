2017 was a busy year! Since launching in August, I hosted 6 free online events with 13 speakers and 11 different presentations via [Certified Fresh Events](https://certifiedfreshevents.com) - covering everything from JavaScript to serverless to bots and tech culture. If you missed any of these, they are all recorded and available for free!

Here's some of what you may have missed this year...
